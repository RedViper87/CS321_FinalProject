# CS321_FinalProject ~ My Movie Library

**Team Members:** Shane Parten, Lily Jaiswal, Zach Weissend, Ethan Alexander

## Project Description
This movie library tool will provide users a streamline way to search, sort, collect, review, and save different movie titles under their own personal accounts. Users will be interacting with this tool through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which will include features such as drag-and-drop, buttons, checkboxes, and drop down menus. All information will be saved on disk so as to not lose user account information.
> Note: not a professional quality app, rough around the edges, gets the job done, enjoy!
